            <br>
        <p>I am a 2nd Year BMA student in Far Eastern University Institute of Technology. I specialize in photography, filmmaking, videography, color grading, and video editing.</p><br>
        <p>I love arts ever since I was born and exposed to it. My older cousins influenced me to the skill of drawing such as anime and cartoons. It became a part of my life even on the days I am in my school and drawing random concepts and ideas on the back of my notebook and sheets of paper. I draw every free time and the moment I finished my exams when I was in elementary.</p><br>
        <p>In Junior High School, I started to love photography because of the youtubers named Cong TV and Rogerraker. They influenced me and helped me grow my skills and passion in photography from just using my mobile phone to owning my first ever DSLR. I learned on my own by just watching online tutorial and youtube videos.</p><br>
        <p>I pursued arts the day I chose my strand in SHS as Visual Arts Strand in University of the East Caloocan. I learned and improved my skills and my foundations in traditional arts which I thought I lost my skills because of focusing too much in photography and filmmaking.</p><br>
        <p>With the years of experience and building connections, I got recognized by some people with the skills I have and it became a part of my commissions that helped me to earn money.</p><br>
